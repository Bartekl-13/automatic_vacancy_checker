# Automatic registration for OGUN courses

This is a python-based application. It's functionality focuses on checking for vacant spots on the University of Warsaw registration site for OGUNs.

### SETUP

To use this app you need to download it onto your computer ( or pull from github into a local repository ).
Then, fill our four variables that need to be defined:

1. YOUR_USERNAME, where you write your PESEL number (which is usually a username for USOS Rejestracje Å»etonowe )
2. YOUR_PASSWORD, where you write your password for USOS ( remember to not share the file with your password in it! )
3. INTERVAL, which is set to 1 hour as a default, it allows you to change the interval after which the site is scraped to check if there are free spots to register
4. course_url, where you paste the https://..... url for the course that you want to sign up for

If you don't have python installed go to this page:
https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
and choose the latest release for your device.

After filling out those variables you need to open command line on your device by using shortcut WINDOWS+R and writing _cmd_ in there, or just searching it in the Windows tab. Then you need to run the following command to install following packages:
pip install selenium pymsgbox
Then navigate to the directory your webscrape.py file was downloaded for example:
cd path/to/your/script/directory
And run the script using the following command:
python webscrape.py

New Google Chrome window should pop up, and if everything works correctly you will be logged in and a notification will pop up saying if you were registered, or that there is no vacancies.
